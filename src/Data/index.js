    about: 'I study at a vocational university in Sweden, Stockholm Institute of Technology and the main focus in this course is to give its students a wide variety of different experiences in the programming field. During my time here I have strengthened my knowledge in many areas regarding UX/UI, JavaScript, HTML5 & CSS, Java and Swift. I have also acquired insight in database management, working with API:s and I just recently completed the first out of two internships, with the latter starting in february 2020.',
    myProjects: 'During my time as an  intern in autumn 2019 I worked at a company called MyIndicators, a company that works with digital healtcare. During my two months at MyIndicators I worked with the framework React Native with the goal to develop an android application using their IOS model as a design document. I got first hand experience in working with agile methods namely SCRUM, and I also learned how to manage the state in React Native and different navgation libraries aswell, while constantly following a backend structure in the form of API:s.',
    myli: 'Myli is the app that I was designated to create while interning which is intended to be an aid tool that collects large amounts of personal data to create indicators and subsequently help people stop with negative habits such as smoking or drinking before and after surgery within a span of 8 weeks.
