    about: 'I study at a vocational university in Sweden, Stockholm Institute of Technology and the main focus on this course is to give its students a wide variety of different experiences in the programming field.

I have also acquired insight in database management, working with API:s and I just recently completed the first out of two internships, with the latter starting in february 2020.',
    myProjects: 'During my time as an  intern in autumn 2019 I worked at a company called MyIndicators, a company that works with digital healtcare. During my two months at MyIndicators I worked with the framework React Native to develop an android application using their IOS model as a design document. I got first hand experience in working with agile methods namely SCRUM, and I also learned how to manage the state in React Native and different navgation libraries aswell, while constantly following a backend structure in the form of API:s.',
