    `I am a software developer who studied in Stockholm where I graduated in May 2020.
    I like to build projects to keep my brain going and learn new things.
    The React framework is something that I really enjoy working with and it's something that I 
    am using almost exclusively.
    I have previously worked for a company called Animech where I got the chance to apply my skills and
    knowledge in React in real projects. During my time there I was also taught how to work with CMS, namely
    WordPress.`,
